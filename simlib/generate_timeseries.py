    """Generate time series that is a combination of sine waves with uniform random freq & phase and amplitude.

    This should be similar to band pass filtering random time series, but with a bit more control over frequencies

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_reps : :obj:`int`
        Number of repetitions (voxels) to create time series for
    n_timepoints: :obj:`int`
        Number of time points for each repetition
    n_freq: :obj:`int`
        number of sin waves to add together

    Returns
    -------
    A 2D matrix n_reps time series of n_timepoints durations.
    Each time series has is a combination of n_freq sinusoids each with a random frequency 
    (between 1 cycle for the entire time course & 1 cycle every 5 timepoints),
    a random phase, and a random amplitude (0.1-1.0).
    After the sinusoids are added together they are scaled to have a standard deviation of 1.

    Note
    ----
    This function is used as one of several options for generating simulated time series and should be 
    fairly similar to bandpass filtering random noise (another option)
